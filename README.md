# Scored!
Scored is a game that uses luck to make a score.
It uses Highscore files and Online Highscore files for references for new py developers.
## How to install
Install:
- forcegpu.py
- game.py
- hs.txt
- useGPU.txt


**After that, if you run GAME.PY it should work fine!**
## How to use the GPU
To use the GPU instead of the CPU to run the program, go into the useGPU.txt and change it to True.
To disable it, change the contents of the file content to False.
